# lc3-assembler

This is a very simple assembler for the LC-3 ISA. It is not meant to be robust or feature-complete, but rather a simple tool to help people translate valid LC-3 assembly into machine code. This was coded in a couple hours to help my good friend working with FPGAs not spend precious time writing machine code by hand.
